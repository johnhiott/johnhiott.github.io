Tidely will ask for the following permissions:
<br/><br/>

<ul>
    <li>android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION	</li>
    
    
</ul>These permissions are required to get tide predictions using your current location but not required for app use. If you revoke this permission, you can still get tide predictions by searching for/panning to any coastal area.
