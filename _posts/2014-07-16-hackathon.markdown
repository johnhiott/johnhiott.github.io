#### Overview
A few days ago, I participated in my first hackathon, The Money Event Charlotte Challenge. I had no idea what to expect going into it. On top of being my first hackathon, I had never done any work with the people on my team. Our team included [Trey Robinson](https://twitter.com/rdrobinson3), [Chris Ollenburg](https://twitter.com/collenburg), [Robbie Lowery](https://twitter.com/robbielowery) and myself. Altogether, there were about 50 participants.

Shortly after checking in, we were presented with the guidelines for the event.

- Design a mobile application to enhance the traditional retail shopping experience.
- Use the 2/3 APIs/SDKs provided:
  - Inmar's Digital Coupon API
  - Thinaire's iOS/Android NFC SDK
  - SwipeOut's Payment API

Once we were given instructions, the teams raced to find the best space. We found a private room with plenty of seating and whiteboard space.

The first thing we did was set up a repo on Github and brainstorm ideas on the board. We spent a couple hours designing and brainstorming before we wrote a single line of code.

We designed a gamified shopping app that used beacons and NFC to encourage users to check out new products while in the store. When users visited product displays, we would present them with a coupon for the product.

After working through the night, we had a basic prototype of our application. There was approximately 22 hours of development plus a short nap. We were the first to present. We fired up our sample application and demoed it for the crowd. I could not believe it, we got through the entire presentation and our app worked the way it was supposed to. The whole team felt really good about what we accomplished and believed we had a really good chance of winning. We were right!!

Now we are off to Las Vegas to present our application at Super Mobility Week.

#### How we succeed.

- Great team
- We installed the same IDEs and ensured we all had the needed SDKs installed prior to the event.
- We took our time designing our application before we wrote any code.
- We managed to grab a great working space at the event.
- We were not all developers, Robbie was a designer/analyst.
- We had plenty of caffeine :)
