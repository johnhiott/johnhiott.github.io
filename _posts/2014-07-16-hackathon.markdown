A few days ago, I particapted in my first hack-a-thon,
 The Money Event Charlotte Challenge.  I had no idea what to expect going in to it.  On top of being my first hack-a-thon, I have never done any work with the people on my team.
 Our team included [Trey Robinson](https://twitter.com/rdrobinson3), [Chris Ollenburg](https://twitter.com/collenburg), [Robbie Lowery](https://twitter.com/robbielowery) and me.


There ended having about 50 particapants.


Shortly after checking in, we were presented with the guidelines for the event.

- Design an mobile application to enhance the traditional retail shopping experience.
- Had to use 2/3 APIs/SDKs provided
    - Inmar's Digital Coupon API
    - Thinaire's iOS/Android NFC SDK
    - SwipeOut's Payment API

Once we were given instructions, the teams raced to find the best space.  We found a private room with plenty of seating and whiteboard space.  

The first thing we did was setup a repo on Github and brainstormed ideas on the board.  We spent a couple hours designing and brainstorming before we wrote a single line of code.

We designed a gamified shopping app that used beacons and NFC to encourage users to users to checkout new products while in the store.  When users visited product displays, we would present them a coupon for the product.

After working through the night, we had a basic prototype of our application.



The app works in a unique way: It detects the Beacon and shows relevant coupons using the coupon API with a lock on every offer. All consumers need to do is swipe the screen to unlock the offer, and they earn points by seeing the offer. There is also the provision to earn points by redeeming the offers.The points earned by the consumers integrate with the loyalty program.
The runner-up team came up with a solution that can help skip lines at different stores. The solution offers queue busting, and involves lots of data processing and analytics in the back end.
