One of the most important parts of being a developer is staying current.  This is especially true when you are a mobile developer.

I have put together this list and will make every attempt to update it as I think of more.

### Blogs/Publications

- [Android Weekly](http://androidweekly.net/)
- [Android Developers Blog](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/)


### Social Media

- Twitter is one of my primary sources for new Android information.  [Here](https://twitter.com/rdrobinson3/lists/android/members) is a list of people to follow on Twitter that my friend [Trey Robinson](https://twitter.com/rdrobinson3) put together.
- Github: Using the social aspect of Github, I follow other Android developers and learn about new libraries by monitoring what other developers star.
- Google+:  [The official Google Developers group](https://plus.google.com/+AndroidDevelopers/posts)

### Classes
- [Udacity Android Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801) is a collection of classes sponsored by Google.  Even though you have to pay for the degree, all of the course content is free.

### Books
- [Effective Java](http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-2nd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1443484659&sr=8-1&keywords=effective+java)

### On the Ground

I attend a local Android Meetup.  If there is one in your area, this is a great way to learn and network.
